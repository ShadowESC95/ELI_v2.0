# Blueprint — Operational Realities

What the structural diagrams (`architecture.md`, `diagrams.md`,
`architecture_ascii.md`) **don't** show: cold-start, concurrency/contention,
memory eviction, failure recovery, and the testing strategy. Grounded in the
code + runtime logs. Estimates are marked *(est.)*; everything else is read from
source or measured timings.

---

## 1. Startup / cold-start latency

No wall-clock delta is printed at boot (a `window._debug_boot_ts = time.time()`
hook exists in `gui/eli_pro_audio_gui_MKI.py` but nothing measures against it),
so the number below is reasoned from the boot sequence, not measured.

**Cost breakdown (boot order):**
| Component | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **GGUF model load** | **dominant** | 4.36 GB (7B) / **15.6 GB (24B)** off disk + GPU offload |
| **Vision (Moondream) RESIDENT** | medium | loaded at boot, co-resident; **caps ctx 28672→18432** and holds VRAM even if unused |
| faster-whisper `small.en` | low–med | CPU int8 |
| daemons + 186-cap manifest + persona_updater | low | DB/CPU |
| **embedder (nomic) + FAISS** | **lazy** | load on **first message**, not boot → turn-1 latency bump |

**Estimate *(est.)*:** ~15–40 s warm-cache on the 7B (dominated by model +
resident-vision load); materially worse cold and on the 24B (15.6 GB).

**Cheap wins:** (a) make vision **lazy** (load on first vision use, not boot) —
cuts cold start *and* frees VRAM / restores ctx; (b) instrument `_debug_boot_ts`
to print per-stage deltas so this stops being an estimate.

---

## 2. Resource contention (daemons vs interactive)

**One shared model behind one `RLock` (`engine.py::_gguf_lock`)** — all inference
serializes through it.

**Verified mitigation:** model-using background work uses **non-blocking acquire
+ defer**. Reflection: `self._gguf_lock.acquire(blocking=False)`, 4 retries,
then `"Reflection deferred (GGUF busy)"` and backs off → **yields to interactive
turns**. Correct pattern, and real.

**Risks (honest):**
- Reflection demonstrably defers; **news_synthesis / self_improvement /
  proactive_daemon also call the model** and should all route through the same
  defer guard — verify each does (a direct blocking `gguf_inference` call would
  stall an interactive turn).
- On the **24B-CPU a turn is minutes**, so a deferred daemon waits minutes for a
  window, and any non-deferred model call would block your reply for minutes.
- **Non-model contention** (cheap but ever-present): `persona_updater` writes the
  DB **every turn**; the proactive daemon scans the DB; **ambient vision runs the
  vision model on CPU**; the embedder is a *separate* CPU model — so vector search
  + ambient vision can hit CPU simultaneously.

---

## 3. Memory limits & eviction (two distinct policies)

**(a) Working-memory pins** — `cognition/working_memory.py`:
- `MAX_PINS = 20` hard cap; importance-weighted.
- `MAX_AGE_TURNS = 40` — `_evict_stale()` drops facts unreferenced for 40 turns.
- `_evict_one()` drops lowest-importance-oldest at cap.
- Persisted `ORDER BY importance DESC LIMIT 20`.
→ a principled **importance/age LRU**, bounded.

**(b) Context-window fill (`n_ctx`)** — a *different* mechanism, and the one that
actually bites under pressure:
- `engine.py::_build_enhanced_system` budget-trims the **persona**.
- `_get_chat_response` **recency-truncates `memory_context`** (keeps the latest,
  cuts the head) to fit `n_ctx`.
- The 20 small pins almost always fit, so **retrieved memory is what gets
  evicted under pressure, by recency** — not the pins.

**(c) Long-term store** — SQLite `memories` / `conversation_turns` are
**unbounded on disk**; they never fill the window directly. Retrieval
(FTS5/FAISS/rerank top-k) gates what enters context. The real "limit" is
**retrieval selection + recency truncation**, not a store cap.

---

## 4. Failure recovery — degradation, not rollback

**Grounding escalation** (`runtime/grounding_escalation.py`): each tier is
wrapped in `try/except`; a failing tier **falls through to the next**
(web → local → hedge); the engine hook is itself wrapped
(`"grounding escalation skipped"`) so total failure **degrades to the normal
CHAT answer**. **No rollback — and none needed — because the tiers are
side-effect-free reads** (web search reads; local re-dispatch is read-only).
Nothing mutates, so there's nothing to undo.

**System-wide:** failure handling is **graceful degradation** throughout
(broker → direct GGUF → failed-executor surface; failures logged to the
`failures` table). 

**Gap (honest):** **multi-step write actions** (CREATE_FILE, memory writes, a
multi-action plan) are individually atomic but **not transactional as a group** —
if step 3 fails, steps 1–2 are not rolled back. Rare on the current action set,
but real.

---

## 5. Testing strategy (two layers + the gaps)

**Layer 1 — code correctness:** **106 pytest files (~2,000+ tests)** — routing
patterns, contracts, executor gates, memory, kernel. Fast; run on every change.

**Layer 2 — behavioural eval:** `tools/eval/` (see `eval_harness.md`) drives the
**real pipeline** and asserts on telemetry (action / grounding / response_mode /
latency) + text. Cases seeded from fixed bug-logs as permanent regression guards.

**Gaps that should exist for a system this complex and don't yet:**
1. **No CI** — suites run by manual discipline, not automatically.
2. **No coverage measurement** — hence no exact dead/dormant-code number
   (a `process()`-under-coverage profiler over the 95 stored conversations
   would close this).
3. **Behavioural eval is new and small** (~13 cases) — grow to the ~30–50 seeded
   set and beyond.
4. **No perf/latency regression tracking** and **no multi-model comparison run**
   standing yet — both enabled by the harness, not yet wired.

## 6. Recommended cheap, high-value fixes (grounded in §1–§2)

| Fix | Why | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Lazy vision load** | cuts cold start + frees VRAM + restores ctx (28672 vs 18432) | `perception/vision.py`, boot in `gui/…MKI.py` |
| **Verify every model-calling daemon uses the non-blocking defer** | stops a background job stalling an interactive reply (minutes on 24B) | `runtime/self_improvement.py`, `planning/proactive_daemon.py`, `eli/tools/news/news_synthesis.py` vs `engine.py::_gguf_lock` |
| **Boot-timing instrumentation** | turns "cold start" from estimate → measured | `gui/…MKI.py` `_debug_boot_ts` |
| **Coverage profiler over stored conversations** | exact dead/dormant-code map | new `tools/eval/` profiler |

## Update — 2026-06-09 (scheduled-task dedup; clean shutdown; STT VRAM)
- **Scheduled-task dedup.** Standing nightly jobs (testgen/eval/report) were re-armed on every boot
  AND on completion with no dedup, accumulating copies (observed: 4× testgen / 3× eval).
  `schedule_request` now keeps ONE entry per (kind, request) for recurring jobs, and
  `restore_scheduled_tasks` collapses existing duplicates on boot. With the model-load VRAM
  interlock (a background worker waits for `gguf_inference.is_loaded()` and skips rather than
  cold-loading a second model), background jobs can no longer pile up or starve the main model at
  boot.
- **Clean shutdown (no segfault).** The GUI exited via `sys.exit(app.exec())`, so CPython ran
  llama.cpp + FAISS C++ destructors at interpreter teardown and segfaulted — AFTER state was
  already flushed (session summary written), so nothing was lost, but it dumped core. `main()` now
  runs the shutdown/atexit flush (memory + session summary + explicit model unload) then
  `os._exit(rc)`, bypassing the destructor pass.
- **STT no longer starves the main model:** faster-whisper is VRAM-aware (CPU on ≤8 GB cards), so
  the main model reclaims its GPU layers (gpu_layers 11→99). See `perception.md`.
