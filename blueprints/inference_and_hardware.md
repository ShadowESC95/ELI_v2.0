# ELI Inference & Hardware Boot

How ELI loads a model, talks to it, and adapts to whatever machine it's on. The
inference path is model-agnostic (see memory `eli-model-agnostic`); the boot path
is hardware-adaptive. Files in `eli/cognition/` and `eli/core/`.

## Inference (`cognition/gguf_inference.py`, 2.7k LOC + `inference_broker.py`)

- **Model resolution (`get_model_path`)**: `ELI_GGUF_MODEL_PATH` env →
  `model_path`/`custom_model_path`/`bundled_model_path`/`gguf_model_path` settings
  keys. No baked model; empty default.
- **`load_model(force_reload)`**: resolves `n_ctx` (env → settings →
  `config.get_gguf_n_ctx()`), caps it to `vision_coresident_text_ctx` when a
  co-resident vision model is loaded; resolves `n_gpu_layers` similarly.
- **Graceful GPU-layer fallback**: if context allocation fails at the requested
  layer count, it retries with fewer layers / without flash-attention rather than
  crashing — keeps the model + n_ctx and degrades GPU offload instead.
- **Chat templating is family-aware**: `_is_mistral_model` / `_is_chatml_model`
  / `_is_llama_model` sniff the filename to pick the right prompt format. This is
  *adaptation* to whatever model you load (like the ctx table), not a hardcoded
  model — but it is filename-based, so an unrecognised naming scheme falls back
  to a default template.
- **Serialization**: all calls hold `_LLM_CALL_LOCK` (a native RLock from
  `runtime/native_locks`) — llama_cpp is not safe under concurrent calls; this is
  also what vision hot-swap and the ambient daemon coordinate on.
- **Live control**: `get_live_runtime_override`, `unload_model`, `reload_model`
  let the GUI swap models / change settings without a full restart.
- **`InferenceBroker`** (`inference_broker.py`): the higher-level `infer()` /
  `gguf_ready` abstraction the orchestrator, engine, and ReAct loop call, so
  callers don't touch `gguf_inference` directly.

## Hardware profiling (`core/hardware_profile.py`, 1040 LOC)

Free-VRAM-aware sizing:
- `HardwareProfile` dataclass tracks **free** vs total VRAM (free is what
  matters for whether a profile actually loads).
- `_kv_cache_mb(n_ctx, n_layers)` — KV-cache cost.
- `_compute_graph_reserve_mb(n_ctx, batch)` — the **model-agnostic** compute
  buffer estimate (`256MB + 24MB/1K ctx + 1.5MB/batch`), reserved so a profile
  that loads cleanly doesn't then hard-crash on the first decode when the lazy
  compute buffer pushes VRAM over the limit. (This was a real crash class.)
- `_layers_for_size`, `ModelRecommendation` — pick offload layers from model
  size and free VRAM.

## Boot optimizer (`core/startup_hardware_optimizer.py`, 599 LOC)

Runs at startup, writes `artifacts/runtime_hardware_profile.json`:
- `detect_ram_gb`, `detect_cpu_name`, `detect_nvidia_gpus` (+ `detect_other_gpus`
  fallback), `select_gpu`.
- `find_model(settings)` — locate the GGUF.
- **`train_ctx_for_model(model_path)`** — the filename→context table
  (deepseek/llama-3.1/phi/gemma-2 → 128K; qwen2.5/mistral-7b → 32K; older → 8K;
  unknown → 32768). This is the core of model-agnostic context sizing.
- `estimate_layers`, `layer_mb` — VRAM-fit layer count.

## Settings (`core/runtime_settings.py`, 1096 LOC)

- `DEFAULTS` (the full settings schema) + `ENV_TO_KEY` (env-var overrides).
- `load_settings` / `save_settings` / `update_settings`.
- **Redistribution-aware**: `_migrate_legacy_keys` (schema evolution),
  `_resolve_relative_model_paths` + `_heal_model_paths` (fix stale absolute paths
  when the project moves machines), and **`_portable_settings_for_storage`**
  (strip machine-specific values before storage). The intent to keep settings
  portable across machines is built in — though personal values like `user_name`
  can still end up tracked (see the settings.json commit note).

## Paths (`core/paths.py`, 551 LOC)

Dev-vs-packaged path resolution: `is_frozen` / `_is_dev_mode`,
`_find_project_root`, then `data_dir`/`config_dir`/`cache_dir`/`models_dir`/
`db_dir`/`artifacts_dir`/`user_db_path`/`agent_db_path`/`memory_db_path`. Source
checkouts use project-local `artifacts/`+`config/`; packaged installs use
platformdirs. One import surface (`get_paths`) so nothing hardcodes locations.

## Honest assessment

- **Strong:** genuinely adaptive and agnostic — free-VRAM-aware sizing, the
  compute-buffer reservation that prevents first-decode crashes, graceful
  GPU-layer fallback, filename→ctx adaptation, env/settings/relative-path healing
  for moving between machines, and a single broker + lock so concurrency is
  correct. This is mature, hard-won infrastructure.
- **Weak / watch:**
  1. **Filename-based family detection** (chat template + ctx) is fragile: a
     model with an unconventional filename gets a default template + 32768 ctx,
     which can be wrong (mis-templated output, or ctx overflow on a small model).
     A metadata/GGUF-header probe would be more robust than string matching.
  2. **Settings sprawl** — `DEFAULTS` is large with several overlapping keys
     (`n_gpu_layers`/`gpu_layers`, `n_ctx`/`context_size`) and migration logic,
     echoing the schema churn seen in `memory/`.
  3. VRAM heuristics are empirically tuned around an 8GB card; very different
     hardware (24GB+, or CPU-only) leans on the conservative fallbacks rather
     than tuned values.
  4. `_portable_settings_for_storage` exists but isn't fully preventing personal
     values (e.g. `user_name`) from being persisted/committed — worth tightening
     for redistribution.

## Update — 2026-06-09 (STT no longer starves the main model)
- faster-whisper preloaded on CUDA **before** the main GGUF autotuned, claiming ~2 GB so on an
  8 GB card the main model only got `gpu_layers=11` (free_vram=4083 MB) → 23–59 s turns. STT is
  now VRAM-aware (`local_whisper_stt`: GPU only on ≥12 GB cards, else CPU), so the main model
  reclaims the GPU — `gpu_layers=99 / ctx=20480` with free_vram ~7 GB, turns back to 1–12 s.
  `ELI_WHISPER_DEVICE` overrides; `ELI_WHISPER_GPU_MIN_MB` tunes the threshold. See
  `perception.md`.
